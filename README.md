# Max-Temperature-of-187-countries

-> This is a Model that predicts the Maximum Temperature of a country based on Percipitation, Average Temperature, Minimum Temperature and other different factors.

-> This dataset that contains 1,392,575 records and 23 columns (Before EDA)

-> I have performed a thorough EDA on the dataset.

-> I have Built the model using KNN algorithm and tried to predict the Maximum Temperature in a Country.
